# 🛡️ Stasher CLI

Share secrets from your terminal. One-time only. No accounts. No backend. No BS.

##Why?

I just wanted to share a password.  
Not spin up a server. Not sign up for a "secure" web app.  
Not trust a Slack thread. Just. Send. A. Secret.

So I built Stasher — a burn-after-read, command-line tool for secure, ephemeral secret sharing.  
Built for people who are busy, paranoid, or both.

## "How Can I Trust You?"

That's what someone asked me — and they were right to.

Even if I say:

*"It's encrypted"*

*"The key never touches the server"*

*"No logs, no tracking, no metadata"...*

How do you know I'm being honest?

## I realized: the more secrecy your secrets require, the more transparency my system must offer.  
So I built Stasher to prove itself.

## Everything Is Verifiable

Every Stasher release:

Is cryptographically signed with Cosign

Includes a SLSA v1 provenance attestation

Publishes a signed SBOM with all dependencies + licenses

Is logged in the Rekor transparency log

Comes with full verification instructions

## Every Line of Code Is Public

Everything that runs Stasher is open and verifiable:

** The only thing we don't expose? Your secret. Everything else is yours to inspect.**

## Why You Might Actually Care

**Zero-knowledge encryption** – AES-256-GCM, done locally

**Burn-after-read** – one use, then it's gone forever

**CLI-first** – pipe it, script it, automate it

**No setup** – just run it with `npx`

 **10-minute expiry** – with proactive + reactive cleanup

**Full supply chain transparency** – signed, attested, and public

## Try It Now

```bash
npx enstash "the launch code is 🍌-42"
# → Outputs: uuid:key

npx destash "uuid:key"
# → Reveals the secret and deletes it forever
```

## 🔐 Trust, But Actually Verify

```bash
# Verify latest release
VERSION=$(npm view stasher-cli version)
npm pack stasher-cli@$VERSION

cosign verify-blob \
  --certificate-identity-regexp="https://github.com/stasher-dev/stasher-cli/.*" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  --signature="stasher-cli-$VERSION.tgz.sig" \
  "stasher-cli-$VERSION.tgz"
```

## 🛠 Usage

### Enstash (Create a Secret)

```bash
# From a string
enstash "don't forget to feed the AI"

# From a file
cat .env | enstash

# From stdin with npx
echo "my passphrase is secret123" | npx enstash
```

### Destash (Read + Burn)

```bash
destash "uuid:base64key"
npx destash "uuid:base64key"
```

### Unstash (Manual Delete)

```bash
unstash "uuid"
unstash "uuid:base64key"
```

## 🧪 Examples

```bash
# Share Wi-Fi password with a guest
npx enstash "yesits1234dontjudge"

# Send a one-time OTP via Slack
npx enstash "OTP: 842991"

# Share a deployment key, then delete it
echo "DEPLOY_KEY=super-secret" | npx enstash
npx unstash "uuid"

# Send a secret via pigeon 🐦
npx enstash "vault code: 1234#"
# (Remind them: 10-minute expiry)
```

## 🔍 How It Works

### 🔐 **Client-Side Encryption**

Stasher encrypts with **AES-256-GCM** before sending anything

It uploads: ciphertext, IV, and tag — **never the key**

You get a `uuid:base64key` token to share

### ⏱ **Hybrid Expiry System** 

**Reactive expiry**: validated on every access  
**Proactive cleanup**: background Durable Object alarms  
**Atomic**: each stash is guarded by its own isolated gatekeeper (one DO per UUID)

### **Burn-After-Read**

Once `destash` is called, the secret is revealed and the stash is burned

No replays, no race conditions — **guaranteed**

## Limits

| Feature | Limit |
|---------|-------|
| Max size | 4 KB |
| Time to live | 10 minutes |
| Access | One-time |

## Install (Optional)

```bash
npm install -g stasher-cli
```

…but honestly? `npx` is faster and cleaner.

## Roadmap

 Add `--json` output format for programmatic use  
 Support custom TTL (time-to-live) settings  
 Add `--verbose` flag for debugging  
 Web interface integration  
 Binary file support with base64 encoding

## Built for Me. Maybe for You Too.

This started as a scratch-my-own-itch project.  
Now it's a zero-trust, burn-after-read tool with full cryptographic supply chain verification.

If that sounds like overkill — good. That's kind of the point.
